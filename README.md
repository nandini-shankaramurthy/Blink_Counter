# Blink_Counter
The Blink Counter project is all about accurately detecting and quantifying eye blinks. Accurately detecting eye blinks has many applications in fields like healthcare, human- computer interactions, fatigue detection, etc. In this project, an eye blink counter system utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze facial landmarks and detect blinks in a video stream.

In my project, I have utilized a computer vision technique to detect and quantify blink events in static data, that is the video of a person blinks more than usual. In my project, I have used the mediapipe framework. Mediapipe framework offers a robust and versatile platform for facial landmark detection and tracking. I have used a mesh solution, Facemesh an available solution in the mediapipe package to extract the coordinates of the facial points, including the eyes and the eyelids. My primary objective in this project is to develop a reliable and efficient method for detecting and counting eye blinks. I have achieved this by implementing a series of computational algorithms and techniques for preprocessing, feature extraction, and blink detection.
